# ForthSS
Forth system / peripherial software for ARM Cortex-M, specifically STM32F
I have written several peripheral drivers using Mecrisp-Stellaris Forth. As I learn this repository I will post here.

I am useing Mecrisp-Stellaris forth for the STM32f429 disco with 8MB ram. I am also using e4thcom to communicate from my laptop. This makes '#include' work properly. The primary reason for presenting this is to provide an example for initiating the sdram. This has been tested using the bin file prior to speeding up the clock. I suspect it will work afterward as it is a direct translation from the peripherial examples given in C.
